This suggests that the Normans originated from Viking settlements in France.\n\nHowever, [Source 3: Report squad_80d1226c] provides more context on the establishment of the Duchy of Normandy. The treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and Rollo, a Viking ruler, established the Duchy of Normandy in 911 as a fiefdom in present-day Upper Normandy.\n\nTherefore, based on these references, it appears that the Normans originated from Viking settlements in France, specifically in the area now known as Normandy.
